In this paper we consider the problem of modeling trajectories as Gaussian processes and learning such models from sets of observed trajectories. We demonstrate that the traditional approach to Gaussian process regression is not suitable when modeling a set of trajectories. Instead we introduce an approach to Gaussian process trajectory regression based on an alternative way of combing two Gaussian process (GP) trajectory models and inverse GP regression. The beneﬁt of our approach is that it works well online and efﬁciently supports sophisticated trajectory model manipulations such as merging and splitting of trajectory models. Splitting and merging is very useful in spatio-temporal activity modeling and learning where trajectory models are considered discrete objects. The presented method and accompanying approximation algorithm have time and memory complexities comparable to state of the art of regular full and approximative GP regression, while having a more ﬂexible model suitable for modeling trajectories. The novelty of our approach is in the very ﬂexible and accurate model, especially for trajectories, and the proposed approximative method based on solving the inverse problem of Gaussian process regression.","tags":[],"title":"Online Sparse Gaussian Process Regression for Trajectory Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Bergström","Mattias Tiger","Fredrik Heintz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1649458099,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649458100,"objectID":"92f54254df301ea5c02d86bdb6f33328","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/publication/bergstrom-bayesian-nodate/","publishdate":"2022-04-08T22:48:19.701873Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bergstrom-bayesian-nodate/","section":"publication","summary":"Validation and veriﬁcation of supervised machine learning models is becoming increasingly important as their complexity and range of applications grows.

The planning takes both discrete and continuous aspects into account, for example action pre-conditions and collision-free action-duration in the conﬁguration space. Safe motion planning rely on wellcalibrated safety-margins for collision checking. The trajectory tracking controller must further be able to reliably execute the motions within this safety margin for the execution to be safe. In this work we are concerned with introspective learning and reasoning about controller performance over time. Normal controller execution of the different actions is learned using machine learning techniques with explicit uncertainty quantiﬁcation, for safe usage in safety-critical applications. By increasing the model accuracy the safety margins can be reduced while maintaining the same safety as before. Reasoning takes place to both verify that the learned models stays safe and to improve collision checking effectiveness in the motion planner using more accurate execution predictions with a smaller safety margin. The presented approach allows for explicit awareness of controller performance under normal circumstances, and detection of incorrect performance in abnormal circumstances. Evaluation is made on the nonlinear dynamics of a quadcopter in 3D using simulation.","tags":[],"title":"Enhancing Lattice-based Motion Planning with Introspective Learning and Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattias Tiger","Fredrik Heintz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649458106,"objectID":"dbfb5751a984fb217c5526f846f6dbf0","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/publication/tiger-incremental-2020/","publishdate":"2022-04-08T22:48:25.26256Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tiger-incremental-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Robot safety is of growing concern given recent developments in intelligent autonomous systems. For complex agents operating in uncertain, complex and rapidly-changing environments it is difficult to guarantee safety without imposing unrealistic assumptions and restrictions. It is therefore necessary to complement traditional formal verification with monitoring of the running system after deployment. Runtime verification can be used to monitor that an agent behaves according to a formal specification. The specification can contain safety-related requirements and assumptions about the environment, environment-agent interactions and agent-agent interactions. A key problem is the uncertain and changing nature of the environment. This necessitates requirements on how probable a certain outcome is and on predictions of future states. We propose Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (ProbSTL) by extending Signal Temporal Logic with a sub-language to allow statements over probabilities, observations and predictions. We further introduce and prove the correctness of the incremental stream reasoning technique progression over well-formed formulas in ProbSTL. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the applicability and benefits of ProbSTL for robot safety.","tags":["Probabilistic logic","Incremental reasoning","Knowledge representation","Runtime verification","Stream reasoning","Temporal logic"],"title":"Incremental reasoning in probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Magnus Selin","Mattias Tiger","Daniel Duberg","Fredrik Heintz","Patric Jensfelt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649458104,"objectID":"aa68f4986e7398650b942824565e26b0","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/publication/selin-efficient-2019/","publishdate":"2022-04-08T22:48:22.964014Z","relpermalink":"/publication/selin-efficient-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Exploration is an important aspect of robotics, whether it is for mapping, rescue missions or path planning in an unknown environment.

However, outside of controlled environments, safe navigation is a very difﬁcult problem. In particular, the real-world often contains both complex 3D structure, and dynamic obstacles such as people or other vehicles. Dynamic obstacles are particularly challenging, as a principled solution requires planning trajectories with regard to both vehicle dynamics, and the motion of the obstacles. Additionally, the real-time requirements imposed by obstacle motion, coupled with real-world computational limitations, make classical optimality and completeness guarantees difﬁcult to satisfy. We present a uniﬁed optimizationbased motion planning and control solution, that can navigate in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. By combining optimal and receding-horizon control, with temporal multi-resolution lattices, we can precompute optimal motion primitives, and allow real-time planning of physically-feasible trajectories in complex environments with dynamic obstacles. We demonstrate the framework by solving difﬁcult indoor 3D quadcopter navigation scenarios, where it is necessary to plan in time.

Local trajectory models are necessary to cope with the multi-modality of such structures, which in turn introduces new challenges. These larger and more complex environments increase the occurrences of lack of motion and self-overlaps in observed trajectories which impose further challenges. In this paper we consider the problem of motion pattern recognition in the setting of sequential local motion pattern models. That is, classifying sub-trajectories from observed trajectories in accordance with which motion pattern that best explains it. We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) based modeling approach which outperforms the stateof-the-art GP based motion pattern approaches at this task. We investigate the impact of varying local model overlap and the length of the observed trajectory trace on the classiﬁcation quality. We further show that introducing a pre-processing step ﬁltering out stops from the training data signiﬁcantly improves the classiﬁcation performance.

Concrete robot soccer examples are given.","tags":[],"title":"Stream Reasoning Using Temporal Logic and Predictive Probabilistic State Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattias Tiger","Fredrik Heintz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649458102,"objectID":"0f8f800525035f0190f1ade85442ab32","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/publication/endriss-towards-2014/","publishdate":"2022-04-08T22:48:21.83768Z","relpermalink":"/publication/endriss-towards-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Towards learning and classifying spatio-temporal activities in a stream processing framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://real.fahimsikder.com/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
